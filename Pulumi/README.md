This repository is designed to help you get started with Pulumi, a modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to manage cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#.

# Introduction
Pulumi bridges the gap between development and operations by allowing you to use real programming languages for infrastructure definition. Whether you are managing AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, or other cloud services, Pulumi helps you write clean, scalable, and testable IaC.

This repository contains step-by-step examples, scripts, and projects to accelerate your learning and application of Pulumi.

## Getting Started

To get started with Pulumi:

Create a new Pulumi project:
```
pulumi new <language>
```
Replace <language> with your choice (e.g., typescript, python, go, csharp).

Define your infrastructure in index.ts (or the equivalent entry file for your language).

Preview and deploy the stack:

pulumi preview
pulumi up
```
Destroy the stack when you're done:
```
pulumi destroy
```
