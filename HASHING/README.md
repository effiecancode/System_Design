# DESIGNING CONSISTENT HASHING

Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique used in distributed systems to achieve load balancing and minimize the need for rehashing when the number of nodes in a system changes. It is particularly useful in distributed hash tables (DHTs), distributed caching systems, and other distributed storage systems

## How Consistent Hashing Works

The basic steps of consistent hashing are:

* Create a hash ring representing the full range of possible hash values (e.g. 0 to 2^32 - 1).
* Hash each node's identifier (like IP address) to place it on the ring.
* Hash each data key to determine its position on the ring.
* Route each data item to the first node encountered moving clockwise from its position on the ring.

## Advantages of Consistent Hashing

Some key benefits of consistent hashing include:

* Load balancing: Distributes data across nodes fairly evenly
* Scalability: Adding/removing nodes only affects a small portion of data
* Minimal remapping: Only K/N data needs redistribution when nodes change, where K is the number of keys and N is the number of nodes
* Increased fault tolerance: Can handle node failures gracefully

## Real-World Applications

Consistent hashing is used in many production systems, including:

* Apache Cassandra for data partitioning
* Amazon DynamoDB for load distribution across storage hosts
* Memcached clients (Ketama algorithm)
