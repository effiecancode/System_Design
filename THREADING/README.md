# Threading in system design

* In system design, threading is used in several scenarios to improve performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization.

## Asynchronous Operations

* Threading is particularly useful for asynchronous operations that involve I/O-bound tasks 1. Examples include:

    Handling multiple network connections simultaneously
    Performing database queries without blocking the main thread
    Reading/writing files without halting the program

* By using threads for these operations, you can improve overall system responsiveness and allow other tasks to continue executing while waiting for I/O completion
